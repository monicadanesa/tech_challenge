                    "description": "After separating with his partner of 9 years, singer/songwriter Axel Mansoor left Los Angeles to get some perspective. He traveled home to Mauritius, an island off the Eastern coast of Madagascar, to visit family and wait out the COVID-19 pandemic. However, stuck on an island without a community, Axel found himself exploring the drop-in audio platform Clubhouse and began singing the world to sleep via his \"Lullaby Club\". In just a few weeks Axel became the app's first breakout music star and was asked to be face of the Clubhouse app icon itself, resulting in his face being placed on millions of phones worldwide. These tokens incorporate that now “iconic” photo taken by Los Angeles-based photographer Zach Bell (@zachbell1212 | zachbellmedia.com) and were designed by multi-media artist Kent Yoshimura, known for his large scale murals and experiential work with brands such as Fear of God, P.

                    "description": "Acclaimed digital artist David Ariew (collaborator with Beeple, Deadmau5 and Zedd) has partnered with alternative pop music artist Janelle Kroll (50 million+ Spotify streams and releases with Saint John, Autograf and Michael Brun) to create this collection, and to raise money to fight global warming. All carbon emissions from the drop will be offset, creating a net positive climate impact.\n \nThe collection includes a full-length music video animated by Ariew that combines photoreal CGI, 3D body scans and facial motion capture with Kroll’s original composition, “Walk with You”. It was directed by Owen Brown (creative direction credits for Bob Moses, ZHU and Apple) and Laura Wass (designs featured by Billie Eilish, Childish Gambino and NYTimes). Additionally, the collection features never-before-seen, limited edition pieces that set Ariew’s visuals over Kroll’s soundscapes.\n\nWhile exploring themes of connection and impermanence, this body of work also serves as an overarching metaphor for climate change. By posing sculptures in the place of icebergs, “Walk With You” humanizes the imminent threat of glaciers melting and the devastating impact that rising sea levels has on our civilization and loved ones.\n\nAs the need to fight global warming has never been greater, this collection was created to take action through art.\n\nThe Walk With You drop on Earth Day is hosted on Crypto.com, an NFT platform specifically selected for the low carbon impact of its blockchain, which uses the Proof-of-Stake Cosmos network. All the project's NFT transactions are expected to have significantly less than 1Tn of carbon impact collectively, yet the initiative will offset 100 Tn of CO2 directly via the CarbonDrop.art/carbondrive initiative that artists like Fvckrender, beeple, GMUNK, Reisinger Andrés, Sara Ludy, Refik Anadol, Kyle Gordon, and Mieke Marple helped create. Through this, we'll create a net positive climate impact. Furthermore, part of the proceeds from the drop will be donated to climate related non-profits. It will support the Open Earth Foundation in their work on open digital technology for transparent climate accountability, and Seed Evolution, which supports indigenous women in Peru and Colombia engaging in nature-based solutions to fight climate change through their goal of planting 5000 trees to benefit over 1000 families.",

Through this approach, he was able to hone and develop his problem-solving skills, which became vital for his work when he was often presented with tight deadlines.\n\nIt was during his studies in Vienna, he met his inspirations; Zaha Hadid and Greg Lynn and, it was at this moment he realized his life had changed forever.\n\nInitially, he would explore media forms such as photography, videography and then eventually found 3D design in the end. Afterward, he began studying visual communication design in Istanbul and focused more on motion design and direction.\n\nAfter spending some time in Istanbul he moved to LA, Kagan would then gain certifications in schools like the school of motion and Gnomon.\n\nKagan has contributed and collaborated with artists such as Cardi B, J Balvin, and Kali Uchis and worked with brands such as Segway Robotics.

Each of his NFTs serve as artefacts from the fictional world of Tarogramma, a place that lives in parallel with our own world. It is a hidden place that explorers have been searching for for centuries; it is believed by some to be an inaccessible forgotten city, others to be the afterlife, and many to be completely fictional. The images function as visual storytelling, similar to a novel or a movie. Images may be objects, portraits or scenes representing the daily lives of inhabitants of Tarogramma. There are recurring characters, icons, clothes, locations and specific artefacts. Each piece has its own unique story that adds to the Tarogramma universe.\n\nCreated with traditional techniques such as drawing, oil painting and sculpture; they are converted into NFTs to tell the story of a world both similar and alien to our own.  \n",

If it is wealth, what kind of wealth it is? Maybe it is grace or beauty then we should ask ourselves what does beauty really mean to us?\n\nChâteau Noir is a reinterpretation of the Sleeping beauty tale seen through the prism of our time. We should not be fooled by the apparent simplicity of myths and fairy tales. Though they come to us from a long past, the depth and beauty, marvel and terror of these earliest stories are echoing the challenges of our time where digital is king.\n\nChâteau Noir highlights the courage of a woman. Her willingness to face challenges, to face solitude, to face the obstacles as well as her internal demons in order to answer a question that we can all ask ourselves: Who lies hidden deep within us?\n\nYou can discover more of the project on my website and social media.\nThis drop is the first one for this project.

Her cosmic vision focuses on daily objects and common feelings just to turn them into something special, as magic as life is (and the moon itself). \n\\\nThe secret of this great success is in the empathy behind every single collage: within them, human emotions always find - drop after drop - a new place to be, without losing their truth. Rather they gain a deeper meaning: while crossing images they get into the essence of a thought, the pureness of a gesture, the source of an idea, and - surprise! - no word is needed.

In 2018, I participated in the young talents contest called \"Yes We Can\", which was held in Germany and participated in Europe. In this competition, the most admired work was the work I created with the visitor votes. I won the right to open a personal exhibition in 2019 because I was the first in the contest. And in 2019, I opened my first solo exhibition in Germany. \n&nbsp;\n\nIn 2019, I participated in the Mediterranean Contemporary Art Prize 19 exhibition held in Venosa, Italy. Soon after, my works were exhibited in many art galleries in Tel Aviv, Israel. I participated in the International Young Talents exhibition in Bangkok, Thailand with 5 works. My 4 works were exhibited at the Lincolner Art Gallery in New York, USA. I have appeared in various newspapers and art magazines, especially in Europe. As of 2020, I am currently participating in the Die Erben Wilhelm Morgner Museum, Germany, with 2 works. For the year 2021, I have participated in the exhibition called The Power of Digital, organized by the German Ministry of Culture, with 4 of my works. -  **Oguz Dogru**",

I create art with 3D, and most of them are artworks in space. Being very much into space art might be because the hours I work without any distraction are the ones at night. Yet, there is a possibility that it is just the dark theme which is very same both at night and in space. I like creating visual stories supporting and combining them with science fiction, mythology and, my imagination to make people have different emotional experiences. \n\nIt is a source of both pleasure and pride for me to be someone whose works were selected by many social media platforms and mentioned by well-known websites. I have directed animated short films that were screened. As a different source of joy and pride, they won prizes in festivals. I worked with art galleries and created visual arts for the screen. That thought a lot in many ways. In that field, my tools are Cinema 4D and Octane Render. As for hobbies, they are digital painting, drawing, photography, and generative arts.",
                    "description": "According to a story, Atlas was condemned by Zeus to carry the sky on his back for eternity after the Titanomachy, the Clash of the Titans. According to the same story, Atlas, who carried the sky on his back for a long time, was freed from this burden for once. It was thanks to Heracles. He carried the sky for a time that Atlas went and took some apples from his daughters. In the end, Atlas got his burden on his back again.\n\nI believe, it is worthy of note that Atlas was able to leave his burden to someone. The thing that kept his burden on his back was what Zeus told him. In my science fiction-styled interpretation of the story, the (condemnation) words of Zeus were the ties connecting Atlas to the world.",

In 2013, he was also named PFA Young Player of the Year, the FWA Footballer of the Year, and the Premier League Player of the Season. He was nominated to the PFA Team of the Year three times in a row between 2011 and 2013.  Gareth joined Real Madrid on September 1st, 2013 for a then world-record transfer fee of €100.8 million, eclipsing the previous record the club had paid for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.\n&nbsp;\n\nBale played an integral role in his first season at Real Madrid, helping the club to win the 2013–14 Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League, scoring in both finals. The following season, he won the UEFA Super Cup and scored in a third major final to help the club win the FIFA Club World Cup. Two years later, he was a key player in another Champions League run, winning the 2015–16 title and being elected to the UEFA Squad of the Season.\n&nbsp;\n\nIn one of the most memorable moments in football history, Gareth scored the winner with a stunning overhead kick in the 2018 European Champions League Final - a goal widely regarded as one of the greatest Champions League goals of all time. Bale made his senior international debut for Wales in May 2006, becoming the youngest player at that point to represent Wales. He has since earned over 90 caps and scored 33 international goals, making him Wales' highest scorer of all time. He has been named Welsh Footballer of the Year a record six times.",

Following his dreams to work in the aerospace industry, John moved to Denver, Colorado where he met Tony, his amazing wine slinging partner, who is a Chef and Sommelier. John’s expansive mind and energetic curiosity led him to enjoy a myriad of creative outlets, such as boulder scrambling, disc golf, searching for the perfect wave to body surf, gardening peppers too hot to eat, and gloving. Between delving into these fine activities, he honors his Irish heritage and cardio needs by participating in Ireland’s true traditional sport: hurling (look it up). Beyond all this, he is an artist, an acrylic painter, whose strokes transcribe exotic dreamscapes to canvas and bring a vibrant lush palette to illuminate new worlds.\n&nbsp;\nThroughout all of these diverse facets of life, his affinity for words never wavered. Transcribed and translated from existential questions to tangible adventure, his and Matt’s world building and galactic lore span a lifetime of curiosity. \n&nbsp;\n[*Read more about the collection and preview some of the pieces on our blog.*](https://medium.com/cryptocomnft/heavy-metal-will-transport-nft-collectors-to-fantastical-new-worlds-fe0ad62faf7c)",

Afterward, he began studying visual communication design in Istanbul and focused more on motion design and direction.\n&nbsp;\nAfter spending some time in Istanbul he moved to LA, Kagan would then gain certifications in schools like the school of motion and Gnomon.

                    "description": "This collection is an extract of a series of artwork, mainly scary and discolored, dealing with a daily life ruled by fears. Worlds where the sky keeps getting darker, people are chased, and disgusting pigs selling cheap lemonade in the woods. I wanted to explore the possibilities of a dark universe, using very sober color palettes, and a very strong frontal exposure, offering very marked shadows, accentuating the details and the coldness of the scene. \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" is a reference to the famous band Pink Floyd. I've always been a big fan of their music, and the movie \"The Wall\" played a huge part in my artistic development and my vision of life. \"Fvck Them\" is obviously a joke. Astronauts have had for a while, and still do sometimes, a huge place in digital art. It was present as a guarantee to get an artwork loved by all. \"Only 25¢\" is a completely offbeat artwork. I wanted to transcribe a rather basic scene, which could even be pleasant, but through the prism of horror.\n\n[Read more about Crypto.com NFT's HODLween Week lineup and preview the other Halloween collections on our blog.](https://medium.com/cryptocomnft/hodlween-week-lineup-announced-84fa566afe18)",

These pieces are influenced by cards of the Tarot deck, from where he brings his own interpretations. He begins with the playful confidence of the Fool, who goes to the unknown without a structure. The Magician transforms that energy to guide it to concrete directions of responsibility with oneself, and finally, the effects of that movement and the creations of that empowered energy, are expanded and enjoyed in The Sun, as an abundant place where the combination of play and work has spiritual enlightenment. Lucas unified these meanings and creates elegant compositions with his handmade inked pointillism technique and a colorful digital painting. His work brings us questions about life and the choices that are in front of us, that we can take to increase understanding and authentic vitalism of ourselves.",

Romero is a veteran film and television producer, director, best-selling comic book writer, CEO of Romero Pictures, and founder of The Veterans’ Compound, a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to helping Veterans through the visual arts and granular aspects of filmmaking.

With two comic books, almost two dozen films, and hundreds of commercial campaigns and brand strategies under his belt, George has written, produced and/or directed more than 35 film, television, and streaming projects and serves as a business consultant and mentor for young and new filmmakers, content creators and entrepreneurs to help them navigate the turbulence of the entertainment industry.\n\n[Read our interview with George C.

The word αἰθήρ (aithḗr) in Homeric Greek means \"pure, fresh air\" or \"clear sky\".\n\nIn Greek mythology, it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the air breathed by mortals. In Medieval science, it was the elements that fills the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere. In modern science, the name has taken a less fictional and more pragmatic meaning however its legacy is full of mystery and remains inspirational.\n\nÆther or Ether has been the progenitor of the word “Etherium”. Perhaps the most prominent crypto-currency today,  created by Vitalik Buterin, it is second only to the “father” of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin. Etherium appears to be very ambitious and right now (2021) is on a wild rise. Only the future will tell how this will unfold, but the topic is on its own inspirational. The NFT Collection \"*Æther*\" is an artistic representation of the coin’s genesis.\n\nThis drop features 2 special NFT giveaways from the creator for anyone who meets the following requirements. \n\nFor the first, any user who holds a collectible from one of Panos Pagonis’ previous drops, and has also purchased one or more collectibles from this drop will be eligible to receive a special edition NFT. \n- Both previous drop NFT and current drop NFT(s) must be in your Crypto.com/NFT wallet by the drop’s end. \n- Primary and secondary purchases are both valid \n\nFor the second, any user who holds 3 or more unique collectibles from this drop will be eligible to receive a special edition NFT. \n- All NFT’s must be in your Crypto.com/NFT wallet by the drop’s end. \n- Primary and secondary purchases are both valid ",
